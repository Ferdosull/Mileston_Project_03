## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

My Milestone Project 3 was envisioned by me and created based on the knowledge gained so far from this course. 
I have taken the fundamentals that I have learned from the course and applied them to this website with style and format changes. 
I have created Python, Jscript and jQuery functions where required to manipulate data, undertake logic and enable the end result back to the user.
I hope that the outcome of my works has translated into a web application UI, that shows and facilitates the CRUD functionality learned throughout the backend development module.
I feel by creating custom, re-usable python code and efficiently structuring my DataBase, I have created a system that could be scalable with minimal effort.
My goal was to create an application that visually appears accessible, responsive and easy to navigate through the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
As well as the course materials, there have been some additional code examples which I have searched for online and utilised.
These additions have been highlighted and referenced later on in this document (references and credits section).
As well as these additions I have received excellent feedback from my mentor Maranatha Ilesanmi.
Maranatha has re-capped and explained the reasons for comments I received from my last Milestone Project and has advised how to improve so that a distinction may be achieved this time around.
I have also added a section in this README file, where I explain what has been implemented in this project to counter act the reasons for falling down in the last project.

## Responsive Design <a name="responsive_design"></a>

As can be seen in the screenshot below, media queries and Materialize classes have been used to ensure that the website is completely responsive across Desktop and Mobile devices.

## My Project Description and Design <a name="project_description"></a>

The SS&J website is a full-stack responsive website which utilises Python, JQuery & javasript methods and functions to carry out CRUD functionality using the Flask framewok and MongoDB Atlas. 
Please see initial envisioned wireframes for desktop and mobile devices (before project start) and actual screenshots of the finished website in the sections that follow:
